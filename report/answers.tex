\textbf{Q1:}
\textit{How does the .p12 file work? Explain what this file is and its relationship to the NTNU CA.}

\paragraph{}
\textbf{Q2:}
\cprotect\textit{Explain what the string \verb/TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA/ means in Figure 4. Comment on security related issues regarding the cryptographic algorithms used to generate and sign your group's web server certificate (key lengths, algorithms, etc.).}

\paragraph{}
\textbf{Q3:}
\textit{List and explain the verifications. What is the difference between the two files? Who has signed the Apache release? What is the point of this process?}

\paragraph{}
\textbf{Q4:}
\textit{What is the purpose of a certificate chain? Describe, on a high-level, the steps that your browser takes when verifying the authenticity of a web page served over HTTPS.}

\paragraph{}
\textbf{Q5:}
\textit{Web servers offering weak cryptography are subject to several attacks. List 3 feasible attacks and explain them briefly. How did you configure your server to prevent such attacks?}

\begin{itemize}
    \item
        FREAK (Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT Keys)\cite{freak-ssl-tls}.
        A client using a vulnerable version of OpenSSL coupled with a server offering export-grade cryptography is exposed to a RSA-to-EXPORT\_RSA downgrade attack.
        The sesion key can then be brute-forced due to the shorter key length of EXPORT\_RSA.

\end{itemize}

All of these attacks are prevented by only allowing strong cipher suites in Apache.

\textbf{Q6:}
\cprotect\textit{Cookies can be a potential security risk if not handled properly, especially if they contain sensitive information. Two important flags can be set on cookies: \verb/HTTP-Only/ and \verb/secure/. What does the \verb/HTTP-Only/ flag do and how does it work? What does the \verb/secure/ flag do and how does it work?}

The \verb/HTTP-Only/ flag makes sure the cookie cannot be accessed from JavaScript. This stops malicious scripts from being able to obtain cookies from websites.

The \verb/secure/ flag ensures the cookie will only be transmitted to the server on HTTPS requests.

\textbf{Q7:}
\textit{What kind of malicious attacks is your web application (PHP) vulnerable to? Describe four briefly, and point out what countermeasures you have developed in your code to prevent such attacks.}

\textbf{SQL injections.} We make sure to use only prepared statements when interfacing the database.
\textbf{XSS}. All user input is escaped before being stored in the database.
\textbf{CSRF}. All forms contain a CSRF token.
\textbf{Cookies shared with other sites on the same domain}. No way to prevent this, because cookies cannot be restricted to only one port on the server.
The easiest way to fix this would be to use a custom domain for our site.
Another way would be using something other than cookies for storing session IDs, for instance JSON Web Tokens.

\textbf{Q8:}
\textit{Explain how you have stored the passwords of your users in your database. Why have you stored them like this? Why is it not a good idea to just store a users password as it is?}

The users' passwords have been hashed with \verb/BCRYPT/.
It is better than SHA1 which is still widely used, blah blah.
If they were stored in plaintext, they would be readable by us and anyone who gains access to the database.
