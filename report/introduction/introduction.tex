\section{Introduction}

In this lab a web page was designed.
While making this design, the main goal was to make it as secure as possible by using state of the art techniques.

A lot of time was spent researching vulnerabilities and known attacks to web servers.
Since this is a shared server with multiple web sites, another dimension to the security was added;
if other people could access our web server folder and get our certificates, they could intercept our HTTPS connection.
We did this to another group, detailed in section \ref{sec:experiments}.

While researching these vulnerabilities, we made sure to verify that we were not vulnerable to any of these.
For each vulnerability we found, we first checked our solution before moving on to other groups.
