\section{Introduction}

In this lab a web page was designed.
While making this design the main goal was to make it as secure as possible.
To make this happen, state of the art techniques and technology are being used.

A lot of time was being spent researching vunerabilities and common attacks to web servers.
Some time was also being used to research not so common attacks.
Since this is a shared server with mutiple web sites another dimension to the security was added.
If other people could access our web server folder and get our certificates, they could intercept our HTTPS connection.

We did this to another gorup and were able to see their whole setup, get all of their certificates and see database passwords.
