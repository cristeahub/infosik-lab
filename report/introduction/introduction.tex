\section{Introduction}

In this lab a web page was designed.
The main goal was to make it as secure as possible by using state of the art techniques.

A lot of time was spent researching vulnerabilities and known attacks to web servers.
Since the project was hosted on a shared server with multiple web sites, multiple new security issues arose.
For instance, if other people could access our web server folder, they could get access to our certificates, passwords etc.

While researching these vulnerabilities, we made sure to verify that we were not vulnerable to any of these.
For each vulnerability we found, we first checked our solution before moving on to other groups.
We feel confident that our implementation is secure, having employed best practices in web development.
