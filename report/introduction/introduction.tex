\section{Introduction}

In this lab a web page was designed.
While making this design the main goal was to make it as secure as possible.
To make this happen, state of the art techniques and technology are being used.

A lot of time was being spent researching vulnerabilities and common attacks to web servers.
Some time was also being used to research not so common attacks.
Since this is a shared server with multiple web sites another dimension to the security was added;
if other people could access our web server folder and get our certificates, they could intercept our HTTPS connection.

We did this to another group and were able to see their whole setup, get all of their certificates and see database passwords.
The setup in this lab, which was given to us from the staff, was to have the same password for the database and the server login, we were therefor able to comprimise their user account.
In addition to this we were able to see what salts they used, how they hashed their passwords and other information that should be kept secret.

While researching these vulnerabilities, we made sure to verify that we were not vulnerable to any of these.
For each vulnerability we found, we first checked our solution before moving on to other groups.
