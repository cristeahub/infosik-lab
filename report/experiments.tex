We managed to get access to the home folder of another group, due to incorrect file permissions.
This gave us access to all of their certificates and their database passwords.
The setup in this lab, which was given to us from the staff, was to have the same password for the database and the server login.
We were therefore able to comprimise their entire user account.
In addition to this, we were able to see what salts they used, how they hashed their passwords and other information that should be kept secret.
