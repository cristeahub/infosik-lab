Another group had incorrectly set their file permissions (execute bit for 'others' group).
This gave us access to all of their files, including server certificates, private keys, and database passwords.
The setup in this lab, which was given to us from the staff, was to have the same password for the database and the server login.
We were therefore able to comprimise their entire user account.

In addition to this, we were able to see what salts they used, how they hashed their passwords and other information that should be kept secret.
